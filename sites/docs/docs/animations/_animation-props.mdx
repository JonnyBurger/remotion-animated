### start?: `number`

Frame at which the animation should start. _Defaults to 0._

:::note Initial values aren't applied before the `start` frame.

- If you want to hide the element before the animation starts, use the `in` prop on the`<Animated>` component to set the in frame for the entire animation.
- If you want the animated property to have a different initial value, you may change it beforehand using your own styling.
